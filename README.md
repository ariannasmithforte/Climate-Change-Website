# Climate-Change-Website

Here is my climate change activism website that I designed and developed utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website educates visitors about the consequences of climate change and empowers the user with actionable strategies like eliminating food waste, recycling, and using clean energy.
- The about.hmtl holds the "About" side of my website, which introduces myself and my purpose in creating this activism website.
- The index.hmtl holds the "Home" side of my website, which informs the readers of the impact on climate change on our Earth and has pictures that illustrate the importance of the situation.
- The take action.html hold the "Take Action" side of my website, which gives the reader actionable resources that all users can do to reduce their carbon footprint.
- The script.js holds the adds some interation to the website, in the random question generator in the bottom of the Home Screen, which has 6 different facts.
- The style.css hold all of the code that changes the background color, the images displayed, the font/font color, and many other designs in the website.
- Here below are the three images that I used in the website:
