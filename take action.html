Also, Shifting diets from meat to plant-based diets can reduce carbon footprint. It has been shown that vegans have the smallest footprint.</p>
     
  <h3>Recycling and Reducing Waste!</h3>
      <p>  Waste prevention and Reclying helps reduce greehouse gases and carbon footprint by decreasing energy production. Using recycled material decreases the need for new materials and Reducing Waste decreases the need for waste incineration. Both of these actions cause an increase of greenhouse gases.
